        <h5>No matter what happens to the NBA’s power structure in June, the 2017-18 campaign has already reminded us of this: Narratives are often wrong.

                        Defending champion Golden State was supposed to be even better in Year No. 2 with Kevin Durant, and the rest of the league was supposed to be left clutching their shorts as they tried to keep up. Yet with less than a month remaining in the regular season,  Houston  (54-14) has a 2  1/2-game lead on the Warriors (52-17) in the West and Toronto is tied with them in terms of league-wide records.
                        
                        In that vein, here’s a question that would have seemed unfathomable a few months ago: Are Portland and Utah the only teams capable of putting a scare into the West’s elite come playoff time?
                        
                        It’s one thing for the fans and media to overlook these efforts, but the Warriors and Rockets would be well-advised to pay attention to the Jazz and Blazers. And for everyone else, here’s what you need to know about two of the league’s best under-the-radar teams.
